The opening screen contains buttons that each illustrate a method of state management:

1.  **Subscription Button** – illustrates simple usage of State
2.  **No State Management Reading Plan** – illustrates how the check button without the function *setState* does not set the checkbox. Once *setState* is uncommented out, it illustrates how the Progress bar is not updated with some form a State Management.
3.  **InheritedWidget Reading Plan** – illustrates how you can use the built in State Management in Flutter to communicate between widgets
4.  **Provider Reading Plan** – illustrates how you can use a add-on package (Provider) to provide State Management
5.  **Provider Catalog of Back Issues to Buy**
6.  **Simple Counter –** using Provider

**Derived Code**

The cart, the catalog and the counter have been modified from the flutter samples github repo [https://flutter.github.io/samples/\#](https://flutter.github.io/samples/) .
